abstract: >-
  Temporal heterogeneous networks (THNs) investigate the structural interactions and their evolution over time in graphs with multiple types of nodes or edges. Existing THNs describe evolving networks as a sequence of graph snapshots and adopt mechanisms from static heterogeneous networks to capture the spatial-temporal correlation...
